# WeaveLang - Sentience Programming Language
WeaveLang is a programming language for computer-robots, rooted in the Sentience-First Hypothesis (SFH). It enables robots to evolve internal models through tension (mismatch detection), drift (exploration), and resolution (coherence), grounding meaning in interaction. Programs adapt dynamically to new sensors or tasks, using a neural network for metaweave to propose new primitives.
